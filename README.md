# ProyectoAM_Bela
I am creating a Modular synthesizer with Bela for my personal project for Acústica Musical for the degree of Sound and Image engineering at the University of Málaga.
I started using their GUI which is available in the provided interface and the idea is to bring it to hardware.
As for the GUI's interface, I used p5.js to create my own designed "dashboard".
The final idea is to use hardware components like button and potentiometers to change the wave form it's amplitude and frequency.
